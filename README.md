🧩 Bigbluebutton-Meeting-Api
A modular and extensible .NET Core API project for managing BigBlueButton video conferencing sessions with integrated AWS services, clean architecture patterns, and domain-driven design principles.

> 💻 **Frontend Interface:** [Bigbluebutton-Meeting-Vue](https://github.com/ismaile17/Bigbluebutton-Meeting-Vue) — Vue 3-based UI for this API

🚀 Features
✅ Full BigBlueButton API integration (Create/Join/End Meetings, Recordings, etc.)

☁️ AWS integration for infrastructure components

🧱 Clean Architecture (Domain, Application, Infrastructure layers)

🛠️ Custom reusable framework modules (Api, Shared, Core)

🔐 Secure and scalable API foundation

🧪 Use Case
This project is designed to:

Host and manage video meetings via BigBlueButton

Create custom meeting flows, like user join URLs and configuration XMLs

Use BigBlueButton’s recording, metadata, and playback features

Be embedded into ERP or education platforms needing remote sessions

Use AWS infrastructure (e.g., SNS, S3, etc.) for scaling and messaging

📁 Automatic Backup of Recordings to AWS
All meeting recordings generated by BigBlueButton are automatically backed up to AWS (e.g., S3) via integrated background services. This ensures:

Long-term durability of media files

Easy access for external systems or audits

Disaster recovery readiness

Optional lifecycle policies for archiving or cost optimization

The integration handles:

Fetching recording metadata

Downloading recording assets

Uploading to specified AWS bucket with appropriate structure and permissions

👥 Advanced Participant Reporting
The system collects and reports detailed attendee analytics such as:

Join and leave timestamps

Total attendance duration

IP and client metadata

Role (moderator/attendee), actions (e.g., speaking, screen sharing)

Exportable data (CSV, JSON) for further processing or compliance tracking

This allows educators or administrators to:

Track engagement

Monitor user behavior in real time

Automatically generate attendance sheets

🏫 Classroom & Content Management
The platform supports virtual classroom creation with assigned:

Roles (e.g., teacher, student, assistant)

Custom permissions per class

Group-specific BBB meetings

Each class can have:

📚 Homework / Assignments with due dates

📎 File attachments and study materials

📌 Pinned tasks or announcements

🗂️ A centralized dashboard to manage all content and progress

These components are stored in the application layer and can be extended with external services (e.g., notifications, grading systems).

🔗 BigBlueButton Integration
Located in: Bigbluebutton/Core/BigBlueButtonAPIClient.cs

This class provides:

CreateMeetingAsync()

JoinMeetingAsync()

EndMeetingAsync()

GetMeetingInfoAsync()

GetRecordingsAsync()

PublishRecordingsAsync()

DeleteRecordingsAsync()

💡 Uses a UrlBuilder to dynamically generate API requests with secure checksums.

🔒 AWS Integration
Located in: AWS/Helper/ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs

Services and infrastructure for AWS-based logic

Extensible AddAWSService registration method

Designed to plug in notification systems (e.g., SNS) or storage (e.g., S3)

🎛️ Configuration
BigBlueButton settings are injected using BigBlueButtonAPISettings. It supports:

BBB server base URL

Secret for checksum signing

Default config XML paths

🧪 Example Flow
Client hits CreateMeeting endpoint.

API uses BigBlueButtonAPIClient → builds and signs URL.

Meeting is created on BBB.

Join URL is generated and returned.

User joins with parameters (e.g., moderator, avatar).

Optionally, recording or meeting info is retrieved via the API.
